# Car-Sales-analysis-using-python
## Introduction
This project aims to investigate the Car Sales Dataset, which contains information on various car models, manufacturers, and features, as well as their sales and pricing data. Our objective is to answer several questions, including:
- Which manufacturer has the highest and lowest average sales volume?
- How are car prices distributed?
- Is there a correlation between numerical variables in the dataset?
- What are the most popular car brands?
- Which three fuel-efficient cars have an engine size above 2.5 liters?
The goal is to analyze the data to determine if there has been significant growth in car production, pricing, and efficiency over the years. We will use Python to create charts and perform statistical analysis in an easy-to-understand format.

## Data Source
The data was obtained from a Google Drive link shared on a WhatsApp group as part of the PSP Data Analytics class. The folder contained the car sales CSV file and assessment questions.

## Data Preparation
Before analyzing the data, we will prepare the Python environment by importing necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We will then read in the data in CSV format.

## Data Exploration
We will explore the data by checking the number of rows and columns, data types, and missing values. We will also perform descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis to answer the research questions.

## Data Cleaning
We will handle missing values by replacing them with the average of the respective columns and dropping rows with missing values. We will also rename columns and check for duplicates.

## Descriptive Statistics
We will perform descriptive statistics on numerical columns to find mean, median, mode, and other measures.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will answer the research questions using various analysis techniques, including grouping, sorting, and correlation matrix analysis."
